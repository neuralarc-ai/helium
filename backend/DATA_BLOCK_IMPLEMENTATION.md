# DATA BLOCK Implementation for Knowledge Base

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the DATA BLOCK format for knowledge base file ingestion, which addresses the issues of incorrect CSV data extraction and failed context injection.

## Problem Statement

The user was experiencing two primary issues:

1. **Incorrect CSV Data Extraction**: CSV files were being stored in raw format, causing LLM confusion and attempts to access local files
2. **Failed Context Injection**: Knowledge base data was not consistently being injected into system prompts

## Solution: DATA BLOCK Format

All file content is now wrapped in a standardized "DATA BLOCK" format that clearly signals to the LLM that the content is pre-extracted data, not a file to be processed from the filesystem.

### Format Structure

```
### DATA BLOCK: {filename}

(This is extracted content. Use it directly. Do NOT attempt to open or create files.)

{actual file content}
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- `backend/knowledge_base/file_processor.py` - Main file processor class

### Key Changes

1. **CSV Processing** (`_extract_csv_content`):
   - Wraps CSV content in DATA BLOCK format
   - Preserves structure with headers, data rows, and summary
   - Limits to first 100 rows to prevent context overflow
   - Includes metadata about total rows and columns

2. **Text Processing** (`_extract_text_content`):
   - Wraps plain text content in DATA BLOCK format
   - Maintains original text structure

3. **PDF Processing** (`_extract_pdf_content`):
   - Wraps extracted PDF text in DATA BLOCK format
   - Maintains fallback chain (PyMuPDF → pdfminer → PyPDF2)

4. **DOCX Processing** (`_extract_docx_content`):
   - Wraps extracted DOCX text in DATA BLOCK format

5. **ZIP Processing** (`_process_zip_file`, `_process_global_zip_file`):
   - ZIP container entries now use DATA BLOCK format
   - Individual extracted files use DATA BLOCK format via `_extract_file_content`

6. **Git Repository Processing** (`process_git_repository`):
   - Repository entries now use DATA BLOCK format
   - Individual files use DATA BLOCK format via `_extract_file_content`

### New Helper Method

- `_format_as_data_block(content, filename)`: Centralized method for creating DATA BLOCK format

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Signal to LLM**: Explicit "DATA BLOCK" header and instructions prevent confusion
2. **Reduced Hallucinations**: LLM is less likely to attempt file operations
3. **Improved Efficiency**: Pre-formatted data is ready for direct use
4. **Consistent Format**: All file types now use the same standardized format
5. **Better Context Injection**: Structured format improves knowledge base retrieval

## Example Output

### CSV File
```
### DATA BLOCK: sample.csv

(This is extracted content. Use it directly. Do NOT attempt to open or create files.)

**COLUMN HEADERS:**
`name,age,city`

**DATA ROWS:**
Row 1: `John,25,New York`
Row 2: `Jane,30,Los Angeles`
Row 3: `Bob,35,Chicago`

**SUMMARY:**
- Total rows: 4
- Total columns: 3
- Data rows: 3
```

### Text File
```
### DATA BLOCK: sample.txt

(This is extracted content. Use it directly. Do NOT attempt to open or create files.)

This is the content of the text file.
It can contain multiple lines.
And various characters.
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- CSV files (with proper structure preservation)
- Text files (with encoding detection)
- PDF files (with fallback extraction methods)
- DOCX files (with text extraction)
- ZIP files (with container and extracted file formatting)
- Git repositories (with repository and file formatting)

## Backward Compatibility

This change is fully backward compatible:
- Existing knowledge base entries remain unchanged
- New uploads automatically use the DATA BLOCK format
- No changes required to frontend or API endpoints
- Database schema remains the same

## Future Enhancements

1. **Content Type Detection**: Could add specific formatting for different file types
2. **Metadata Enhancement**: Could include more detailed file metadata in DATA BLOCKS
3. **Content Chunking**: Could implement intelligent content splitting for very large files
4. **Format Validation**: Could add validation to ensure DATA BLOCK format is maintained

## Conclusion

The DATA BLOCK implementation successfully addresses the identified issues by providing a clear, consistent format for all knowledge base content. This ensures that LLMs can effectively use the knowledge base without confusion or attempts to access local files.

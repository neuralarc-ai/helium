# Improved Knowledge Base System

## Overview

The improved knowledge base system implements a **data block architecture** that provides significantly better RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) results compared to the traditional approach. Instead of treating entire files as single units, this system breaks down structured data into intelligent, queryable blocks with rich metadata.

## Key Benefits

### üéØ **Precise Retrieval**
- **Before**: Entire files returned for queries, often including irrelevant information
- **After**: Only relevant data blocks returned, with context-aware filtering

### üß† **Intelligent Understanding**
- **Before**: Simple text matching and basic embeddings
- **After**: Multi-stage filtering using metadata, semantic similarity, and business logic

### üìä **Structured Data Intelligence**
- **Before**: CSV files treated as plain text
- **After**: Automatic column analysis, grouping, and business insights extraction

### üîç **Context-Aware Search**
- **Before**: One-size-fits-all search
- **After**: Specialized retrieval for financial analysis, departmental queries, and trend analysis

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Blocks (`kb_data_blocks`)
The core of the system - intelligent chunks of data with:
- **Content**: The actual data or text
- **Metadata**: Structured information about the block
- **Categories**: Business classifications (financial, operational, etc.)
- **Entities**: Named entities found in the data
- **Importance Score**: Calculated relevance score
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations for semantic search

### 2. File Metadata (`kb_file_metadata`)
Rich metadata about uploaded files:
- **CSV Analysis**: Column types, data quality, business categories
- **Time Periods**: Date ranges and granularity detection
- **Key Entities**: Important business terms and categories
- **Quality Score**: Overall data quality assessment

### 3. Intelligent Retrieval Functions
Advanced RAG functions that understand:
- **Query Intent**: Analysis, comparison, summary, or specific data requests
- **Business Context**: Department, time period, data type awareness
- **Semantic Relationships**: Content and metadata-based relevance scoring

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend/knowledge_base
pip install -r requirements_improved_ingestion.txt
```

### 2. Database Setup
The system requires the improved database schema. Run the migration:
```sql
-- This should already be done based on your setup
-- The migration creates all necessary tables and functions
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for improved pipeline
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/database

# Optional for OpenAI embeddings (falls back to sentence-transformers)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Processing

```python
from knowledge_base.improved_integration import improved_kb_manager

# Process a CSV file with the improved pipeline
result = await improved_kb_manager.process_file_with_improved_pipeline(
    file_content=file_bytes,
    filename="budget_analysis.csv",
    account_id="user123",
    name="Q4 Budget Analysis",
    description="Quarterly budget vs actual spending"
)

print(f"Created {result['data_blocks_created']} data blocks")
print(f"Quality score: {result['quality_score']}")
```

### Intelligent Context Retrieval

```python
# Get context for financial analysis
context = await improved_kb_manager.get_improved_kb_context(
    query="Show me budget variances by department for Q4",
    account_id="user123",
    max_tokens=8000
)

print(context)
```

### Data Block Search

```python
# Search for specific data blocks
blocks = await improved_kb_manager.search_data_blocks(
    query="Retail Banking budget variance",
    account_id="user123",
    max_results=5,
    similarity_threshold=0.4
)

for block in blocks:
    print(f"Block: {block['content_summary']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {block['relevance_score']}")
    print(f"Type: {block['block_type']}")
```

### Get File Details

```python
# Get detailed metadata for a processed file
metadata = await improved_kb_manager.get_file_metadata("entry_id_here")

if metadata:
    print(f"File type: {metadata['file_type']}")
    print(f"Data categories: {metadata['data_categories']}")
    print(f"Quality score: {metadata['data_quality_score']}")
    
    if metadata['file_type'] == 'csv':
        print(f"Columns: {metadata['csv_columns']}")
        print(f"Row count: {metadata['csv_row_count']}")
```

## How It Works

### 1. File Ingestion Process

```
Uploaded File ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Data Blocks ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Ready for RAG
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì
   CSV/PDF    Column/Content  Grouped   Database   Semantic
   File       Analysis        Blocks    Storage    Search
```

### 2. Data Block Creation Strategies

#### CSV Files
- **Grouped Blocks**: Data grouped by department, category, time period
- **Summary Blocks**: Aggregated statistics and overviews
- **Analysis Blocks**: Variance analysis, trend detection, insights

#### Example CSV Processing
```csv
department,year,quarter,budget,actual
Retail Banking,2023,Q1,1000000,950000
Retail Banking,2023,Q2,1100000,1050000
Commercial Banking,2023,Q1,2000000,2100000
```

**Creates blocks for:**
- Retail Banking Q1-Q2 data
- Commercial Banking Q1 data
- Overall budget vs actual summary
- Variance analysis by department
- Trend analysis across quarters

### 3. Intelligent Retrieval Process

```
